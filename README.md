# Reliability-Data-Plot
* These are graphical plots of reliability data which are quick and useful visual test to determine if a particular model is consistent  with an observed data from an operating system or manufacturing equipment

* The process is conducted by graphically investigating failure points calculated from the data and are plotted on a log-log scale in which they are approximately aligned and consistent with the straight line curve. This process is considered for failure data from a non-repairable population known as life distribution to determine the type of distribution models which could either be exponential, weibul or lognormal distribution

* In this project we conducted a test to determine the model distribution of the failure points from a life distribution. Failure points are time-stampt periods in which a system, machine or equipment malfunctions, fails or stops operating under normal condition and requires a repair.
